# Ezchain-A DECENTRALIZED SCALE-OUT BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER SYSTEM FOR WEB3.0

The development of underlying technologies in blockchain mostly revolves around a difficult problem: how to enhance the performance of the system and reduce various costs of nodes (such as storage and verification) without compromising systemâ€™s security and decentralization. Layer-1 sharding, layer-2 off-chain solutions and cross-chain protocols have provided elegant solutions for this challenge. However, they cannot yet be considered as a "silver bullet". We proposes a novel decentralized scale-out ledger system designed for web3.0, aiming to enable blockchain technology to truly support ledger applications in large-scale fully decentralized networks.
