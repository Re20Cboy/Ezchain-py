# Ezchain-A DECENTRALIZED SCALE-OUT BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER SYSTEM FOR WEB3.0

The development of underlying technologies in blockchain mostly revolves around a difficult problem: how to enhance the performance of the system and reduce various costs of nodes (such as storage and verification) without compromising system’s security and decentralization. Layer-1 sharding, layer-2 off-chain solutions and cross-chain protocols have provided elegant solutions for this challenge. However, they cannot yet be considered as a "silver bullet". We proposes a novel decentralized scale-out ledger system designed for web3.0, aiming to enable blockchain technology to truly support ledger applications in large-scale fully decentralized networks.

## Features

* Scalability: System throughput is directly proportional to node size, not constrained by bandwidth resources.
* Hardware Compatibility: Designed for consumer-grade hardware, supporting necessary storage, computation, and verification requirements.
* Efficient Transaction Confirmation: Strives to keep transaction confirmation delays within one minute.
* Decentralization and Security: Maintains strict adherence to decentralization principles and ensures robust security​​.
